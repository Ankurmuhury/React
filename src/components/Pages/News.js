      New Delhi: The BJP is set to retain Tripura, an aggregate of four exit
      polls showed on Monday, following a closely-watched multi-cornered
      contest. The BJP could win about 32 of 60 seats, while the Left-Congress
      alliance could score 15 and the Tipra Motha 12, the polls said. Exit polls
      often get the result wrong, and the Election Commission is set to count
      the votes on Thursday. Tripura voted on February 16, seeing nearly 88 per
      cent turnout with "largely peaceful" polling, according to the Election
      Commission.
